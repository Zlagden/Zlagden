👋 Hey there, I’m Zak Lagden
Full-stack developer | Product enthusiast | Physiotherapist

I’m a full-stack developer with experience in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, SQL, CSS, HTML, and GitHub workflows, building intuitive, data-driven web applications. I recently completed the Le Wagon bootcamp, where I designed, implemented, and shipped projects including Explore Abroad (a visa/job requirements app) and FrogBnB (a playful Airbnb-inspired platform).

💡 With a background in healthcare and product, I bring a unique perspective to software development—combining analytical thinking, user empathy, and a focus on creating solutions that genuinely improve experiences. My time as a physiotherapist taught me how to understand people’s needs deeply and design systems that empower them, a mindset I now apply to building digital products.

🌍 I’m especially interested in product management, developer platforms, and wellness technology, where I can bridge the gap between technical delivery and user-centred design.

🚀 Always learning, I’m currently expanding my knowledge of product strategy, experimentation, and modern frameworks while continuing to refine my skills in full-stack engineering.
